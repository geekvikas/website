# Burn.ly - Simple, old school - ZERO TAX

> Last Updated: Feb 21, 2022

### **** THIS IS DRAFT VERSION *****

Lets start with something that we all an agree upon. Taxes are no good. Not in Crypto, not in real life. If they are anything, at best, they are SCAM. Majority of taxes either to Govt. or Crypto Project Owners are never used for real benefits.

People launch #MEME and charge 5-20% taxes to do what? Just pump up their own wallets, yeah we not doing that. We commited to community from Day 0 - If anything that I dont want to do myself, I will not ask you to do it.

I want to lay down some bullet points, I dont call this a white paper but more of my brain dump. We will evolve as the community what this project can and will be.
* Will it be DAO? 
* Will it be its own Blockchain (not level 2)? 
* Will it go beyond just something good for trading? 


**WE ALL SHALL RISE ABOVE THAT, FOCUS ON BUIDLING, MONEY FOLLOW THE TALENT & STRONG COMMUNITY**

One thing that I sure want to keep in mind and engage with is community, we need a stronger community where everyone's voice is heard. So here are current phases that I can think of, atypical than most crypto projects. 

Coming from a Sillicon Valley background, I have put the phases in the order of how a typical company goes from growth phases. We are nothing but a startup and I would like to approach it in same manner. There will be many people doubting, many trying to take advantage and create **FUD**  


# Phase 1 - PRE SEED FUNDING
âœ… We do a fair launch 
>  Announcement came [before launcing](https://twitter.com/burn_ly/status/1495569413243752449?s=20&t=srfcotxeef0wzrUCnkEYCg) the crypto
>  Also right [after we became live](https://twitter.com/burn_ly/status/1495594665495695366?s=20&t=srfcotxeef0wzrUCnkEYCg) and right after adding liquidity

âœ… Launch a [Telegram group](https://t.me/burn_ly)

ðŸš€ We build a community of **1000 strong HOLDERS**, ðŸ’ŽðŸ™Œ as they say

ðŸš€ We finish the first version of Website
> Include Whitepaper
> Include basic project details and directions

ðŸš€ CoinGecko.com listing

# Phase 2 - Invest in Product
ðŸš€ We do not have to wait till 100K HOLDERS to start building the right product

ðŸš€ Hire top notch developers and start work on a new contract to allow staking of Burn.ly and earn passive income

ðŸš€ Uniswap and other DEX listings

ðŸš€ We can aim to complete this phase before we hit **50_000 HODLERS** 

# Phase 3 - Seed Round

ðŸš€ We sell the vision to Whales, get BIG accounts to BUY & HOLD

ðŸš€ Right after we get our first whale, we approach CoinMarketCap & few exchanges.
> Focus is still very much on BUIDLING rather than PROFITS
> Community need to be strong, with strong vision than short term profits

ðŸš€ We complete this round and should be a ðŸ¦„ with over $1 Billion valuation as we complete our Seed Round

ðŸš€ We can aim to complete this phase with **100K - 250K HODLERS** 

# Phase 4 - Growth Phase

ðŸš€ Heavy marketing, billboards, aerial marketing, dedicated merch shop.

ðŸš€ Launch the **roadmap** for our own **#testnet** and **#mainnet** 

ðŸš€ We should have enough buzz with big names that people want to list us rather than we approaching them.


# Phase 5 - IPO & Utility

ðŸš€ This is when people who been loyal to project from Early Days gets the most benefits. I imagine if we launch our full scale #mainnet project then to do a **FULL SWAP** of ERC20 token, Burn it to ground and give the **NEW NATIVE TOKEN**

ðŸš€ Diamond Hands will be rewarded favorly than others

ðŸš€ There will be different tiers of rewards
> Diamond Hands - HODLER > 1 year
> Golden Hands - HODLER 6 months - 1 year
> Silver Hands - HODLER 1 - 6 months
> Bronze Hands - HODLER < 1 months

ðŸš€ I hope we will be over $10 Billion Valuation now and have the following in place ready to go full scale
> #mainnet
> Native Mobile Apps
> Staking / Delegating rewards (passive income)
> 500_000 - 750_000 HODLERS
